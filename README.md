anet.plugin.syntaxhighlight
===========================

This plugin provides server-side syntax highlighting for code that is wrapped
inside of a `<pre>` block.

Requirements
------------

This plugin depends upon the PEAR module Text_Highlighter. Some features will
work without that module, but the actual color syntax highlighting will not.

To install the needed PEAR module, as the root user issue the following
command:

`pear install Text_Highlighter-beta`

Marking Code for Syntax Highlight
---------------------------------

Blah blah
